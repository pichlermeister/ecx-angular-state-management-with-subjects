# EcxAngularStateManagementWithSubjects

This repo contains a code-challange for Angular State Management with Subjects.
It's a TODO app which initially manages the ToDos locally in the Angular Component itself. This way, the ToDos won't survive navigation through different routes.

The master branch already has the solution implemented. The Challenge can be found in the `challenge` branch.

## Stackblitz

Checkout Challenge on [Stackblit](https://stackblitz.com/github/pichlermeister/ecx-angular-state-management-with-subjects/tree/challenge)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
